GuildExport
===========

About
-----

Exports all of your members rank, level, class and note to xml. Very useful for websites.

We use it to update our roster on dbh-wow.dk/miniroster, where we use the notes to connect the alts with their main.

Notes
-----

Like all things wow, the xml-file will be in utf-8 format, so make sure your website and editors handles utf-8 correct.

Commands:
---------

/ge export - shows popup window with the xml to copy.
/ge csv - shows popup window with the csv to copy.
